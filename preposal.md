## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I have an idea to somewhat automate the check-in process for my karate studio.
Currently we have attendance cards which the students pull from a box, then hand to us, which we have to individually mark and then type the name into our management program. It's annoying, tedious, and I when I finish a long night of teaching classes, the last thing I want to do is type names. I want to reduce my typing to just two space presses per child. One press to take picture from webcam, pull the student's name, then display it on the screen for confirmation, then a second press to confirm and check the the student into the system. 
I learned in an OwlHacks workshop how to automate a login, which would save some more time.

A possible alternative implementation would be to get the names first, save to a text file, and do the login and check in at the end. I think it would be slightly more efficient, as the check in takes a second to load on the management program, so instead of waiting in between each photo for the check in to complete, I could take all the photos first and then let the check in run on its own after.

I have no idea how accurate the tesseract library is (the library I intend to use to extract names from the images), and the management program is slow and pretty garbage, not to mention there are definitely discrepancies between the names on cards and the names in the system, so if this works even a little bit I'll be happy. I have zero expectation that this will work completely as intended.


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Me, Myself, and I

## Do you have any questions of your own?

If you know any other libraries that may be helpful, let me know!
